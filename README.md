## How to Solve a Git Conflict During a Rebase

When performing a Git rebase, you might encounter conflicts that need to be resolved manually. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to handle these conflicts in the terminal:

### 1. Start the Rebase

Begin the rebase process with:

```bash
git rebase <branch-name>
```

Replace `<branch-name>` with the branch you are rebasing onto.

### 2. Encountering a Conflict

If Git encounters a conflict during the rebase, it will stop and notify you:

```plaintext
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <file-path>
Automatic rebase stopped due to conflicts.
```

### 3. View Conflicted Files

To see which files have conflicts, use:

```bash
git status
```

Look for files listed under "both modified."

### 4. Resolve Conflicts

Open the conflicted file(s) in your preferred text editor and look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`). Edit the file to resolve the conflicts manually, removing the markers and making sure the code is correct.

Example conflict markers:

```plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
your changes
=======
incoming changes
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

Edit to look like:

```plaintext
final resolved code
```

### 5. Mark Resolved Files

After resolving the conflicts, mark the files as resolved with:

```bash
git add <file-path>
```

Replace `<file-path>` with the path of the resolved file.

### 6. Continue the Rebase

Continue the rebase process with:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

If there are more conflicts, repeat steps 3-6.

### 7. Abort the Rebase (if necessary)

If you decide you do not want to continue the rebase, you can abort it:

```bash
git rebase --abort
```

This command will return you to the state before the rebase started.

### 8. Complete the Rebase

Once all conflicts are resolved and you have continued through all commits, the rebase will complete successfully. You can then push your rebased branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

**Note:** Be cautious with `--force-with-lease` as it will overwrite the remote branch with your local changes.

### Summary

- Start the rebase: `git rebase <branch-name>`
- Resolve conflicts manually
- Mark resolved files with `git add <file-path>`
- Continue rebase: `git rebase --continue`
- Abort rebase if needed: `git rebase --abort`
- Push changes: `git push --force-with-lease`

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and resolve conflicts during a Git rebase from the terminal.
